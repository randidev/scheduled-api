## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm run install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

If this process takes too long then you might need to build the application first:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) with your browser to see the result.
